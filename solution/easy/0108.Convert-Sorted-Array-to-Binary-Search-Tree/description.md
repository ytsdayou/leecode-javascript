# [108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)

Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a 
height-balanced binary search tree.

```
Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:
```
Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation: [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
